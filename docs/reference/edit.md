# Edit package

```js
import { edit } from '@muze-labs/simplyflow-edit'
```

The edit package is experimental and lives outside the core `@muze-labs/simplyflow` package. It builds an editing application on top of SimplyFlow's app, state and binding APIs.

## `edit(rootElement)`

Creates an editing app rooted at `rootElement`.

```js
const editor = edit(document.querySelector('#editor'))
```

Current behavior includes actions for enabling/disabling `contenteditable`, editor shortcuts and toolbar components.

## Stability

This package is not part of the beginner-facing application API and still contains experimental editor-specific assumptions. Treat it as a work-in-progress example of building a larger app layer on top of SimplyFlow rather than a stable reference API.
